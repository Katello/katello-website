The Katello Website is a Wordpress based setup with a layout and hooks that support deployment on OpenShift.  For more information on the setup the site is based off of please see https://github.com/openshift/wordpress-example

Running Locally
===============

In order to run and develop the Katello Website locally, you will need a standard Apache, PHP and MySql setup.  You will need to setup a standard MySQL server and take note of the databse name, username and password.  

Clone the repository and make Apache aware the location of files.  One strategy for doing this is cloning the repository directly in to /var/www/html.  In the php/ directory copy the wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php and set the DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD and DB_HOST appropriately.  The site should be up and running locally and available for hacking.

Repo layout
===========
php/ - Externally exposed php code goes here
libs/ - Additional libraries
misc/ - For not-externally exposed php code
../data - For persistent data (NOTE: plugins are symlinked here to prevent admin console initiated updates from being overwritten) (full path in environment var: OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR)
deplist.txt - list of pears to install
.openshift/action_hooks/pre_build - Script that gets run every git push before the build
.openshift/action_hooks/build - Script that gets run every git push as part of the build process (on the CI system if available)
.openshift/action_hooks/deploy - Script that gets run every git push after build but before the app is restarted
.openshift/action_hooks/post_deploy - Script that gets run every git push after the app is restarted


Notes about layout
==================
Please leave php, libs and data directories but feel free to create additional
directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated
please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in ../data which will
persist between pushes of your repo.


Environment Variables
=====================

OpenShift provides several environment variables to reference for ease
of use.  The following list are some common variables but far from exhaustive:

    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME']  - Application name
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_GEAR_DIR']   - Application dir
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR']  - For persistent storage (between pushes)
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR']   - Temp storage (unmodified files deleted after 10 days)

When embedding a database using 'rhc app cartridge add', you can reference environment
variables for username, host and password:

    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_DB_HOST']      - DB host
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_DB_PORT']      - DB Port
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_DB_USERNAME']  - DB Username
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_DB_PASSWORD']  - DB Password

To get a full list of environment variables, simply add a line in your
.openshift/action_hooks/build script that says "export" and push.

deplist.txt
===========

A list of pears to install, line by line on the server.  This will happen when
the user git pushes.
